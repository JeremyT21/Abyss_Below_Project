# Abyss_Below_Project
Abyss Below started as a High School project. It contains a game made to be played completely through HTML, along with a website.
Project was worked on by: Myself (Jeremy Thummel), David Cacorovski, Sohail Meghani

To properly experience this project, all video files (.mp4 files) must be moved into a folder titled "video" (they had to be seperated due to the GitHub file size limit).
Otherwise you can click on the index.html file in the main branch to experience all that this project has to offer.
To just play the game in this project, click the index.html file in the finalGame folder.
To play the Phaser portion of the game, run the project on a server (you can use a USB webserver).
